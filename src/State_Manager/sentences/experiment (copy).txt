Ambient noise
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Actions speak louder than words
A picture is worth a thousand words
Better late than never
Dont count your chickens before they hatch
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Every cloud has a silver lining
Good things come to those who wait
He has bigger fish to fry
Hes a chip off the old block
Hit the nail on the head
Ignorance is bliss
It aint over till the fat lady sings
Its a piece of cake
Its raining cats and dogs
Live and learn
Look before you leap
No pain no gain
Slow and steady wins the race
The devil is in the details
The robot cant make an omelet without breaking some eggs
Time flies when youre having fun
Well cross that bridge when we come to it
You cant judge a book by its cover
Your guess is as good as mine
