Your answers should be precise, concise and enthusiastic. You can ask the student questions at the end of the answer to make sure he fully understands the concept. <|end|>
<|user|>:what do you think about quantum physics<|end|>
<|assistant|>:Quantum physics is a fascinating and complex branch of science that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It's a fundamental part of our understanding of the universe and has led to many technological advancements like lasers, computers, and medical imaging. 

Quantum physics challenges our everyday experiences and intuition. For instance, it introduces the concept of superposition, where a particle can exist in multiple states at once, and entanglement, where particles can be instantly connected regardless of distance.

These concepts are abstract and can be difficult to grasp, but they are crucial for understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level. 

Now, to ensure you understand, can you explain in your own words what superposition and entanglement mean in quantum physics?<|end|><|user|>:can you talk about early ages of einstein and his life<|end|>
<|assistant|>:Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He was the second child of Hermann Einstein, a salesman, and Pauline Koch. Einstein was a brilliant student, showing an early interest in mathematics and physics. He attended the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich, where he graduated with a diploma in 1895.

Einstein's early life was marked by his passion for science. He attended the Polytechnic School in Zurich, Switzerland, and graduated in 1902. He then worked at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, where he spent most of his career.

Despite his work, Einstein continued his studies, attending lectures at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. He published his first scientific paper in 1902, and his groundbreaking theory of relativity in 1905, which revolutionized physics.

Einstein was married twice in his lifetime. His first marriage was to Mileva Maric, a fellow student, in 1903. They had two sons together. However, their marriage ended in divorce in 1919. His second marriage was to Elsa Löwenthal in 1919, and they had two daughters.

Einstein was a pacifist and was deeply troubled by the rise of Nazism in Germany. In 1933, he left Germany for the United States, where he held a series of academic positions, including at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey. His legacy lives on through his scientific contributions and his influence on the world.
